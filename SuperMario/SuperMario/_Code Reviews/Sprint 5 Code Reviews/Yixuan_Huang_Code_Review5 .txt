Specific comments on code quality: 

This program file contains many different code smells. From line 17 to line 29, the code has feature envy set up.It is good! 
Then, the update function upto line 40 do the update and it seems that wehn the spritesheet moves to the third frame, the bomb will explose. It is smart to
use spritesheet frame as a fake "timer" instead of using the real timer to set the time. The overall code smells are not bad; however, there are some problems 
when I do the code review, or there maybe some improvement which can be applied in BombExplosion.cs.


Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 5 minutes
In the update method, you just put the tool(bomb) into the collision manager and do the rest update. However, it seems that some properties can be just updated
in this method. It does not really need to do everything in other place. I think it weill make the code much easierto understand.

Furthermore, the bomb explosion seems have a larger collision bounding box, I think in current file, the bomb explosion bounding box is the same as the spritesheet bounding box size,
so the refactor or improvement need to be done. 

Also, currently, the bomb will explose and break everything in the explosion area. However, I think the ground should not be crashed by bomb. This is another problem that need to be fixed.
