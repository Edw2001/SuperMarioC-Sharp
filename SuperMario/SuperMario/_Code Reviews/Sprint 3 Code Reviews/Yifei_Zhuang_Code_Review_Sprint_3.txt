There are quite a bit different methods that were not ever referenced. Some of the duplicated methods that has different parameter passes in can be combined to a same one, for example, the Rectangle nBBox can just not be passed in and use and use the next one which is "new Rectangle((int)(nPos.X - nSprite.Width), (int)(nPos.Y - nSprite.Height), (int)(nSprite.Width), (int)(nSprite.Height))" to achieve the same functionality. 
The collision response has in the form of list<tuple<...>> which i think there might be a more easier way to do. Some of other ones involves collision manager which has for example the DeRegEntity and the regEntity is used whenever update the uncollidible items which is a little bit reduntant.
