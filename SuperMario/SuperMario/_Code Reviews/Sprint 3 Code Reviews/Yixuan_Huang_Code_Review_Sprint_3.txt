The IItemState class has now set three response after the collsision with question block: Emerging, Idle, and Collecting. The only suggestion is that it would be 
better to write item state specific item, for example, CoinState, MushroomState, and StarState. This will provide a much clearer view for other programmers. Besides,
Writing the item state spereately will also benefit for flexiblity.
