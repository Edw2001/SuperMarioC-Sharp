Sprint number: 3
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: Enemy.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Yixuan
Specific comments on code quality: The structure of the code is very well done. The cyclomatic complexity and code smells are low as it has good coupling and cohesion.
The Enemy class allows for enemy entities to have correct behavior and had strict time constraints which could explain the innacuracies.

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 10 minutes

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
A change that I would make would be to add the collision responses to a seperate class such that the Enemy class only has implementations for enemy behaviors.
I would also get rid of the kill method and move it to a state design pattern such that the enemy can keep track of its own class and change its internal state depending on the
given commands from the collision manager. Overall, a very well done class with just a couple of small refactoring nitpicks.
