Sprint number: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: BrickBlockCollision.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Yixuan
Specific comments on code quality: Overall could be better, however, the collision works and had strict time constraints which could explain the innacuracies.

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 10 minutes

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Something that I would change to the current file would be to refactor the code to reduce the cyclomatic complexity.
As it currently is the cyclomatic complexity is very high as there is a very large if tree deciding what collisions to execute related to the block.
As such, if we were to use a switch case, we could reduce the cyclomatic complexity to a lower degree.
Along with this the collisions for mario and block could be placed in seperate files to create higher cohesion.
Overall while this file could be written better the overall coding practices utilized are great and allow for a user to understand the code given to them.
