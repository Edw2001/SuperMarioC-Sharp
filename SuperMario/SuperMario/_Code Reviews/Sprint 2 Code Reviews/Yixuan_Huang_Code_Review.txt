I think there are too much constructors and I suggest that you can refactor the form in order to shrink the code lines. Besides, You really forget to add the ITEM enum so that when Mario collide with 
power up mushroom or fire flower, there is a correct enum which can represent these collision. Besides,there are two Draw function which really makes me feel confuse before you explain to us.
