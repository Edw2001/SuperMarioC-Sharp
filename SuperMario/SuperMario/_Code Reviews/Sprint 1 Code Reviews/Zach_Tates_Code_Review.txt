Sprint number: 1
Name of the .cs file being reviewed:Game1.cs
Specific comments on code quality: The quality of the code was overall well written with a
few unnecessary declarations that could have been solved through inheretence with seperate
classes. For example, the way that ICommand is implemented is realatively confusing to users
when it could have been implemented in a way that can be used by any user.

Number of minutes taken to complete the review:10
A hypothetical change to make the code better: A change that could make the code better would
to change the way that commands are implemented by putting them into a dictionary or implementing
them with a class that stores all command implementations.
