A spritefactory class helps a lot for simplizing the all assorted sprite files. And also it contains more cohesive relationships between different concrete classes. However, a quite obvious 
question is that there are many variables and method. The overall quality could be much better if some of the method and variables could be combined.
Still, the overall logics are great, and it make life easier to write the monogame. Lastly, I would hope that in future, there could be more methods and related correlations added into the 
sprite factory. The reason is that there're not that much really useful method yet.
