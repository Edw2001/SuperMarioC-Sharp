Specific comments on code quality: I think the quality is kinda of alright consider the time frame we have. There are quite a bit code that should be moved to other class or be removed simply because it was never really used. But not gonna lie, the code allow the game to work!

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 12 minutes

Some of the game state is currently lives in game1. I think it would be better managed if they are at a speparate class. So as the time count. I think currently, it lives in game1 cause some of the game mode is accessable trough game1. I think it would be better to move to a different class which calls the gamemode. And because of the game state, the game over screen and the winning screen is determined inside game 1 which can be moved with the gamemode to a different file. And again, the restart method can just be combined to one method but passing in level strings into the method so the duplicate code can be removed.
