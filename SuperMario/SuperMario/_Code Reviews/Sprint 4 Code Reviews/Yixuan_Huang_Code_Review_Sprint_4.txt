Specific comments on code quality: The code overall is not bad, but it does not need to have such class.

Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 5 minutes

The DeadMario.cs is used for holding the Dead State. Besides, DeadMario.cs also count the Mario life number in the game. Every time when Mario dies, the life
count will minue 1. Dead Mario also has its own BGM and movement: it can only move up and down unless you use the cheat code to respawn. I think we have too much
different Mario state classes, and in those classes, some parts of the code are the same, the only differences are BGM, Movement, and spritesheets. Maybe, we can
try to simplfiy our Mario classes. Or we should still use the Mario Factory. I am not quite sure whether our Mario Factory still be used. Our file system is 
mess, and most classes are not in the correct place. Furthermore, our current Mario movement is werid. We need press left or right arrow twice in order to let Mario
turn around to another side, and out Mario jump state also has some problem. 

Moreover, Mario collision with blocks is terrible. Sometimes, Mario collide with blocks in the middle, but Mario will flash to the top of that block and stand there.
I think that should be fixed. However, the overall game can be played and Mario does not have so bugs which will crash the programm. That may be the only goode news.
